What is it
==========
Script that I am gradually hanging my analyses off of. Focus is on amplitude
analysis; older things that will need some hacking to bring into the main analysis
have been dumped into scripts/old

Checkout and download
=====================
I pushed it to here:

I am not really the git expert, but you can get a copy using

git clone git@github.com:chrisrogers1234/efficiency_study.git

Quick start
===========

The basic execution of the analysis is done by a command like:

python scripts/bin/run_one_analysis.py scripts/config/config_reco.py 0
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^
       main program                    configuration file            specify which data set in
                                                                     the config file to analyse

The config file defines all of the run control variables, file locations, cut
parameters etc. It is possible to run several analyses in parallel by doing

python scripts/bin/run_many_analyses.py

Edit the "run_many_analyses.py" script to control which analyses to run. 

I often show tableaux of several plots from different analyses in a single 
canvas. This is done using the script

python scripts/bin/conglomerate_plots.py

There is one more top-level script, "move_to_paper.bash" which copies files 
across to the "emittance paper" location (specified in the bash file)
